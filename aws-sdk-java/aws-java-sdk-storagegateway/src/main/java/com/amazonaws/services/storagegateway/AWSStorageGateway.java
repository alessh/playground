/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Storage Gateway.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Storage Gateway Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software
 * appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration
 * between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage
 * infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS
 * cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the following links to get started using the <i>AWS Storage Gateway
 * Service API Reference</i>:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders.html"
 * >AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers</a>: Describes the required
 * headers that you must send with every POST request to AWS Storage Gateway.</li>
 * <li><a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests.html"
 * >Signing Requests</a>: AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate
 * every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.</li>
 * <li><a href=

 * >Error Responses</a>: Provides reference information about AWS Storage
 * Gateway errors.</li>
 * <li><a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPIOperations.html"
 * >Operations in AWS Storage Gateway</a>: Contains detailed descriptions of all

 * Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints</a>: Provides a list of each of the s
 * and endpoints available for use with AWS Storage Gateway.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <note>AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these
 * resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase.
 * You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For
 * example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-1122AABB. When
 * you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-1122aabb.
 * Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.</note>
