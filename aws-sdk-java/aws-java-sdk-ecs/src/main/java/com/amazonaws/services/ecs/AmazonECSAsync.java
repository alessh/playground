 * Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
 * container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
 * Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch
 * and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to
 * get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you
 * access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS
 * volumes, and IAM roles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your
 * cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability
 * requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to
 * operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or
 * worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
     * During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition
     * of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation), the service

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler

     * AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on
     * the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to
