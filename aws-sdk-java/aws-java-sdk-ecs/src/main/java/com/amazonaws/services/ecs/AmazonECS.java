/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon ECS.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
 * container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
 * Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch
 * and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to
 * get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you
 * access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS
 * volumes, and IAM roles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your
 * cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability
 * requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to
 * operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or
 * worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

     * <p>
     * Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task
     * definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below
     * <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another instantiation of the
     * task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see
     * <a>UpdateService</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
     * During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition
     * of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation), the service
     * scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and
     * <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment
     * strategy.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler
     * can ignore the <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment.
     * For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four
     * tasks, a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50% allows the scheduler
     * to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for
     * services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if
     * they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that
     * <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the
     * <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance it is hosted on is
     * reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for
     * <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in the console and 100% for the
     * AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on
     * the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to
     * define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a
     * <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>maximumPercent</code>
     * value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks
     * (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).
     * The default value for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance
     * them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following
     * logic:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support
     * your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU,
     * memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks
     * for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
     * example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each
     * have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered
     * optimal for placement.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal
     * Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container
     * instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

     * Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, or task definition
     * used in a service.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task
     * definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is
     * running in and a new <code>desiredCount</code> parameter.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use <a>UpdateService</a> to modify your task definition and
     * deploy a new version of your service.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a
     * deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the
     * service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters,
     * <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code>, to
     * determine the deployment strategy.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler
     * can ignore the <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment.
     * For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four
     * tasks, a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50% allows the scheduler
     * to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for
     * services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if
     * they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that
     * <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the
     * <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance it is hosted on is
     * reported as healthy by the load balancer.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on
     * the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to
     * define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a
     * <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>maximumPercent</code>
     * value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks
     * (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the
     * equivalent of <code>docker stop</code> is issued to the containers
     * running in the task. This results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a
     * 30-second timeout, after which <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the
     * containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the
     * <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from
     * receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance
     * them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following
     * logic:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support
     * your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU,
     * memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks
     * for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
     * example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each
     * have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered
     * optimal for placement.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal
     * Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container
     * instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.
     * </p>
     * </li>
