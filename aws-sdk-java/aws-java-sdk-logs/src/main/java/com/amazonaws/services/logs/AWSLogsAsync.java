/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch Logs asynchronously. Each
 * asynchronous method will return a Java Future object representing the
 * asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be
 * used to receive notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference</fullname>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log
 * files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon
 * CloudTrail, or other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data
 * from CloudWatch Logs using the Amazon CloudWatch console, the CloudWatch Logs
 * commands in the AWS CLI, the CloudWatch Logs API, or the CloudWatch Logs SDK.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use CloudWatch Logs to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time</b>: You can use
 * CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For
 * example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your
 * application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors
 * exceeds a threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for
 * monitoring; so, no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor
 * application logs for specific literal terms (such as
 * "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal
 * term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an
 * Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch
 * Logs reports the data to a Amazon CloudWatch metric that you specify.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Monitor Amazon CloudTrail Logged Events</b>: You can create alarms in
 * Amazon CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as
 * captured by CloudTrail and use the notification to perform troubleshooting.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Archive Log Data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
 * in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that
 * any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted. The
 * CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and
 * non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then
 * access the raw log data when you need it.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
