/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch Events.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
 * resources. When your resources change state they automatically send events
 * into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the
 * stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to
 * take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure
 * rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an
 * event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</li>
 * <li>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream
 * for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</li>
 * <li>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon
 * EBS volume.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information about Amazon CloudWatch Events features, see the <a
 * href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide">Amazon
 * CloudWatch Developer Guide</a>.
