/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch Events asynchronously. Each
 * asynchronous method will return a Java Future object representing the
 * asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be
 * used to receive notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
 * resources. When your resources change state they automatically send events
 * into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the
 * stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to
 * take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure
 * rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an
 * event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</li>
 * <li>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream
 * for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</li>
 * <li>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon
 * EBS volume.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information about Amazon CloudWatch Events features, see the <a
 * href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide">Amazon
 * CloudWatch Developer Guide</a>.

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Input</b> and <b>InputPath</b> are mutually-exclusive and optional
     * parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event,
     * if for a target:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Neither <b>Input</b> nor <b>InputPath</b> is specified, then the
     * entire event is passed to the target in JSON form.</li>
     * <li><b>InputPath</b> is specified in the form of JSONPath (e.g.
     * <b>$.detail</b>), then only the part of the event specified in the path
     * is passed to the target (e.g. only the detail part of the event is
     * passed).</li>
     * <li><b>Input</b> is specified in the form of a valid JSON, then the
     * matched event is overridden with this constant.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> When you add targets to a rule, when the associated rule
     * triggers, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Please
     * allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
