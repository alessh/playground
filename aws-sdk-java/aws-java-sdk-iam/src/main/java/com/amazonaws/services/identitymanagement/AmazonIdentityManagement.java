/**
 * Interface for accessing IAM.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Identity and Access Management</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can use to
 * manage users and user permissions under your AWS account. This guide provides
 * descriptions of IAM actions that you can call programmatically. For general
 * information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity
 * and Access Management (IAM)</a>. For the user guide for IAM, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Using IAM</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
 * programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.).
 * The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and
 * AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically
 * signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests
 * automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download
 * and install them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for
 * Amazon Web Services</a> page. </note>
 * <p>
 * We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM.
 * However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM
 * web service. To learn more about the IAM Query API, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html"
 * >Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>Using IAM</i> guide. IAM supports GET
 * and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to
 * use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are
 * subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that
 * require larger sizes, use a POST request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Signing Requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We
 * strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID and
 * secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key ID
 * and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security Token
 * Service to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign
 * requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"
 * >Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an existing application that uses
 * Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4.
 * However, some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation
 * for operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement.
 * </p>
