/**
 * Interface for accessing CodePipeline.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CodePipeline</fullname> <b>Overview</b>
 * <p>
 * This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions
 * of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for
 * your pipeline is only configurable through the API. For additional
 * information, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pipelines/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS
 * CodePipeline User Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions,
 * gates, and transitions, as described below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is
 * uniquely named, and consists of actions, gates, and stages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with pipelines by calling:
 * <ul>
 * <li><a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely-named pipeline.</li>
 * <li><a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</li>
 * <li><a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about a pipeline structure.
 * </li>
 * <li><a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current
 * state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</li>
 * <li><a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines
 * associated with your account.</li>
 * <li><a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the the most recent revision of
 * an artifact through the pipeline.</li>
 * <li><a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to
 * the structure of the pipeline.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Pipelines include <i>stages</i>, which are which are logical groupings of
 * gates and actions. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete
 * before the next stage begins. A stage will result in success or failure. If a
 * stage fails, then the pipeline stops at that stage and will remain stopped
 * until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or
 * a user takes action to re-run the most recent artifact through the pipeline.
 * You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a
 * pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or
 * <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline,
 * including the stages of that pipeline.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i>, which are categorized into categories
 * such as source or build actions performed within a stage of a pipeline. For
 * example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from
 * a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions
 * directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when
 * working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and
 * <a>GetPipelineState</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of
 * artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one
 * stage complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can work with transitions by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from
 * transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</li>
 * <li><a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts
 * between stages in a pipeline.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own
 * integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the
 * standard API user. In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers
 * will need to work with the following items:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Jobs, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source
 * action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.
 * <p>
 * You can work with jobs by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received
 * the specified job,</li>
 * <li><a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act
 * upon,</li>
 * <li><a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure, and</li>
 * <li><a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Third party jobs, which are instances of an action created by a partner
 * action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by
 * members of the AWS Partner Network.
 * <p>
 * You can work with third party jobs by calling:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has
 * received the specified job,</li>
 * <li><a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs
 * to act upon,</li>
 * <li><a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job
 * failure, and</li>
 * <li><a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job
 * success.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
