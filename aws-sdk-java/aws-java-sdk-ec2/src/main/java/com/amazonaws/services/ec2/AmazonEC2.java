     * snapshots include public snapshots available for any AWS account to
     * launch, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by
     * another AWS account but for which you've been given explicit create
     * volume permissions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li><i>public</i>: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume
     * permissions for the snapshot to the <code>all</code> group. All AWS
     * accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.</li>
     * <li><i>explicit</i>: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume
     * permissions to a specific AWS account.</li>
     * <li><i>implicit</i>: An AWS account has implicit create volume
     * permissions for all snapshots it owns.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The list of snapshots returned can be modified by specifying snapshot
     * IDs, snapshot owners, or AWS accounts with create volume permissions. If
     * no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you
     * have create volume permissions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the
     * specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an
     * error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have
     * access, it is not included in the returned results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you specify one or more snapshot owners, only snapshots from the
     * specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results
     * can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners,
     * <code>amazon</code> for snapshots owned by Amazon, or <code>self</code>
     * for snapshots that you own.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create
     * snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS
     * account IDs (if you own the snapshots), <code>self</code> for snapshots
     * for which you own or have explicit permissions, or <code>all</code> for
     * public snapshots.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are describing a long list of snapshots, you can paginate the
     * output to make the list more manageable. The <code>MaxResults</code>
     * parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page.
     * If the list of results exceeds your <code>MaxResults</code> value, then

     * <code>impaired</code> status, then the volume event might be
     * <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This means that your volume

     * <code>impaired</code> and the volume event shows
     * <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action shows

     * launched from such an AMI will not be able to connect to package update
     * infrastructure.
