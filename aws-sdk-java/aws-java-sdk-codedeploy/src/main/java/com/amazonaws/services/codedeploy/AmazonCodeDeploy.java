/**
 * Interface for accessing CodeDeploy.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CodeDeploy</fullname> <b>Overview</b>
 * <p>
 * This reference guide provides descriptions of the AWS CodeDeploy APIs. For
 * more information about AWS CodeDeploy, see the <a
 * href="docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide">AWS CodeDeploy User
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <b>Using the APIs</b>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to work with the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Applications are unique identifiers used by AWS CodeDeploy to ensure the
 * correct combinations of revisions, deployment configurations, and deployment
 * groups are being referenced during deployments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list, and update
 * applications.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Deployment configurations are sets of deployment rules and success and
 * failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during deployments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, and list
 * deployment configurations.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Deployment groups are groups of instances to which application revisions can
 * be deployed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list, and update
 * deployment groups.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Instances represent Amazon EC2 instances to which application revisions are
 * deployed. Instances are identified by their Amazon EC2 tags or Auto Scaling
 * group names. Instances belong to deployment groups.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get and list instance.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Deployments represent the process of deploying revisions to instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, get, list, and stop
 * deployments.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Application revisions are archive files stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub
 * repositories. These revisions contain source content (such as source code,
 * web pages, executable files, and deployment scripts) along with an
 * application specification (AppSpec) file. (The AppSpec file is unique to AWS
 * CodeDeploy; it defines the deployment actions you want AWS CodeDeploy to
 * execute.) Ffor application revisions stored in Amazon S3 buckets, an
 * application revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and
 * its ETag, version, or both. For application revisions stored in GitHub
 * repositories, an application revision is uniquely identified by its
 * repository name and commit ID. Application revisions are deployed through
 * deployment groups.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get, list, and register application
 * revisions.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
