/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS OpsWorks.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS OpsWorks</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>AWS OpsWorks API Reference</i>. This guide provides
 * descriptions, syntax, and usage examples about AWS OpsWorks actions and data
 * types, including common parameters and error codes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks is an application management service that provides an integrated
 * experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For information
 * about this product, go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">AWS
 * OpsWorks</a> details page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>SDKs and CLI</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks API is by using the AWS Command
 * Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement
 * applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">AWS
 * CLI</a></li>
 * <li><a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html"
 * >AWS SDK for Java</a></li>
 * <li><a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm"
 * >AWS SDK for .NET</a></li>

 * for Python(Boto)</a></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks supports only one endpoint, opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 * (HTTPS), so you must connect to that endpoint. You can then use the API to
 * direct AWS OpsWorks to create stacks in any AWS Region.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Chef Versions</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you call <a>CreateStack</a>, <a>CloneStack</a>, or <a>UpdateStack</a> we
 * recommend you use the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify
 * the Chef version. The recommended value for Linux stacks is currently 12 (the
 * default is 11.4). Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <a
 * href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html"
 * >Chef Versions</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We
 * recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as
 * possible.</note>
