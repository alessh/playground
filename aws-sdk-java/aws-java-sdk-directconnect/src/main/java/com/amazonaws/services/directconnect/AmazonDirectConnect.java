/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Direct Connect.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect
 * location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable.
 * One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct
 * Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual
 * interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute
 * Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to
 * Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service
 * providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides
 * access to AWS in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other
 * US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS
 * Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in
 * all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).
