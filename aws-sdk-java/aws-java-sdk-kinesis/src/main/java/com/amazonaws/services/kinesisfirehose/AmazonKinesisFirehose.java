    /**
     * <p>
     * Creates a delivery stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <a>CreateDeliveryStream</a> is an asynchronous operation that immediately
     * returns. The initial status of the delivery stream is
     * <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status
     * is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. Attempts to send data to
     * a delivery stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an
     * exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use
     * <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The name of a delivery stream identifies it. You can't have two delivery
     * streams with the same name in the same region. Two delivery streams in
     * different AWS accounts or different regions in the same AWS account can
     * have the same name.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * By default, you can create up to 5 delivery streams per region.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A delivery stream can only be configured with a single destination,
     * Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift. For correct <a>CreateDeliveryStream</a>
     * request syntax, specify only one destination configuration parameter:
     * either <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code> or
     * <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * As part of <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, optional values
     * <code>BufferingHints</code>, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and
     * <code>CompressionFormat</code> can be provided. By default, if no
     * <code>BufferingHints</code> value is provided, Amazon Kinesis Firehose
     * buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is
     * satisfied first. Note that <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so
     * there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions
     * strictly; for example, record boundaries are such that the size is a
     * little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no
     * encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption
     * to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A few notes about <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate
     * location, as Amazon Kinesis Firehose first delivers data to S3 and then
     * uses <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table.
     * This is specified in the
     * <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> parameter
     * element.</li>
     * <li>The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code>
     * cannot be specified in
     * <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because the
     * Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code> operation that reads from the S3 bucket
     * doesn't support these compression formats.</li>
     * <li>We strongly recommend that the username and password provided is used
     * exclusively for Amazon Kinesis Firehose purposes, and that the
     * permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift
     * <code>INSERT</code> permissions.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Amazon Kinesis Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part
     * of destinations. The IAM role should allow the Amazon Kinesis Firehose
     * principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that
     * allows the service to deliver the data. For more information, see <a
     * href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3"
